# NYC Bike Sharing Study

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze data from New York City based CitiBike and then compile a visualized story of our findings using Tableau. The insights that are highlighted will be used to guide our client and potential investors in a start-up bike sharing company in Des Moines, Iowa.  We used August 2019 data for our analysis under the assumption that there is more bike usage during the summer months in NYC compared to months that would be more affected my inclement weather.
